**Title:**
Introducing Valkry v1.0 — A Competitive Programming Platform

**Post:**
Excited to announce the launch of Valkry v1.0.

A competitive programming platform designed to make practicing data structures and algorithms more structured, engaging, and social.

��� ���𝗮����𝗺:
→ 180+ curated problems across 11 categories
→ Timed arena challenges
→ Structured learning paths

��� 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗘𝗱𝗴𝗲:
→ Add friends and build your coding network
→ Challenge friends to head-to-head matches
→ Real-time matchmaking system
→ Global leaderboard rankings

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆:
Started with React and Vite for a fast, modern frontend. Needed a code editor that felt professional — Monaco Engine (the same one powering VS Code) was the clear choice.

For the backend, Firebase became the backbone: Authentication handles email and Google sign-in, Firestore manages user data and problem sets, and Realtime Database powers the live matchmaking and instant challenge updates.

Building the real-time features — friend challenges syncing instantly, leaderboard updates as you compete — meant diving deep into database architecture, security rules, and state synchronization. Exactly the experience I was looking for.

�𝗵𝗮𝘁'𝘀 ���� (��.�):
→ Control Visualizer — step-by-step code execution visualization, distinct from traditional debuggers
→ RAG-powered contextual hints and explanations

This marks the beginning of my most ambitious project for 2025.

**Title:**
Valkry v1.0 — My Flagship Project for 2025

**Post:**
Valkry v1.0 is now live.

A competitive programming platform that combines structured practice with real social competition.

���𝗮𝘁�𝗿�𝗲𝘀:
• 180+ curated DSA problems
• Arena mode with timed challenges
• Friend system with direct 1v1 challenges
• Real-time matchmaking
• Global leaderboard

𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸:
Chose React + Vite for speed — both in development and performance. Monaco Editor gives the same coding experience as VS Code, which felt essential for a programming platform.

The real challenge was the backend. Firebase handles authentication (email + Google OAuth), but the interesting part was architecting Firestore for complex queries while using Realtime Database for instant updates during live matches.

Writing security rules, managing real-time subscriptions, syncing challenge states between two players — these pushed me to understand database systems at a much deeper level.

𝗩𝟮.� 𝗥𝗼𝗮����:
→ Control Visualizer for step-by-step code execution
→ RAG integration for intelligent learning assistance

Looking forward to building on this foundation throughout 2025.

Valkry v1.0 — Shipped

**Post:**
Launching Valkry — a competitive programming platform.

𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺:
→ 180+ problems, arena mode, learning paths
→ Friend challenges, real-time matchmaking, global leaderboard

𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵:
React + Vite for the frontend. Monaco Editor for a VS Code-like coding experience. Firebase powering auth, database, and real-time sync for instant matchmaking and live challenges.

The real-time features required working with Firestore queries, Realtime Database listeners, and security rules — exactly the backend experience I wanted to build.

𝗩𝟮.𝟬: Control Visualizer (step-by-step code execution) + RAG-powered assistance.

The beginning of my biggest project for 2025.

**Title:**
From Idea to v1.0 — Building Valkry

**Post:**
Valkry v1.0 is live.

The goal was simple: build a competitive coding platform that's actually enjoyable to use. The execution? That's where it got interesting.

𝗧�𝗲 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗳�𝗿�:
180+ problems. Arena mode. Friend challenges. Real-time matchmaking. Global leaderboard.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝗗𝗲𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀:
• React + Vite — fast builds, clean architecture
• Monaco Editor — because the code editor should feel professional
• Firebase Auth — handles email and Google sign-in
• Firestore — user data, problems, progress tracking
• Realtime Database — powers live matchmaking and instant challenge updates

The hardest part wasn't any single feature. It was making everything work together in real-time — two players challenging each other, leaderboards updating instantly, match states syncing without delay.

Getting the security rules, database structure, and real-time subscriptions right taught me more about backend architecture than any tutorial.

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁'𝘀 𝗡𝗲��:
v2.0 introduces Control Visualizer — step-by-step code execution visualization (different from debuggers) — and RAG-powered learning assistance.

My biggest project of 2025 starts here.
